### Firmware
This hackpad uses QMK firmware for everything. 

### BOM:

Here should be everything you need to make this hackpad:
2x SK6812MINI
4x SW_Cherry_MX
1x XIAO-RP2040-DIP

### Extra stuff:
I want to keep updating this project here and there, maybe add a screen in the future and add a potentiometer for volume control.
this the first time i have created a pcb and a 3d model for printing, look forward to make more cool stuff in the future
